My solution is a system variable: 

```
# Step 1
# Open your bash_profile
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

```
# Step 2
# Plaese add a new line with the follow syntax:
export MOVIE_KEY="MY_MOVIE_API_KEY"
```

````
# Step 3
# Update  the terminal configurations
source ~/.bash_profile
````

````
# Step 4
# Please test the configuration
echo $MOVIE_KEY

# The output should be the MOVIE KEY APP value
